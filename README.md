Mapa Potencjału — Lightweight static version (Polish)
This is a single-page static app (HTML/CSS/JS) — no build, works by opening index.html locally or deploying as static files.
Deployment suggestions:
- GitHub Pages: push files to gh-pages branch or use main with GitHub Pages setting.
- Vercel: import repository and deploy (static files).
Usage:
1. Unzip and upload all files to your repository root.
2. Open index.html locally or deploy.
If you see an error, open DevTools Console and paste the error here; I'll fix it.
